# Deploy TF-Keras Model with Flask as Web App

Steps 


1. Clone the repo
2. Download the trained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vDk5TbaXylcjbaxpH6YTyknOQV01C2_3/view?usp=sharing)
3. Add the downloaded weights in models folder
4. Create Virtualenv
   '''bash
   virtualenv env_name
   '''
5. Activate Virtual Env
   '''bash
   source env_name/bin/activate
   '''
6. Install required libraries
   '''bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   '''
7. Run app.py
